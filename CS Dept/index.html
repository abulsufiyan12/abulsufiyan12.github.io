                    <h3>Warhawk Weekly 12-1: Commencement speaker; Professors-N-Pajamas; Ask an Expert</h3>
                    <p>Elizabeth Huntley, a member of the Auburn University Board of Trustees, will serve as the keynote speaker at Auburn University at Montgomery’s Fall 2020 commencement ceremony.

                    AUM’s fall commencement will be held Saturday, Dec. 12, at 10 a.m. at Montgomery’s Garrett Coliseum. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, graduates and their guests will be required to wear face masks and adhere to social distancing and other Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

                    Huntley is an accomplished litigation attorney, dedicated child advocate, author and lecturer. She currently practices law at the Birmingham-based firm Lightfoot, Franklin & White, LLC.

                    “I have worked in multiple disciplines within my profession and continue to evolve,” Huntley said. “Your work life and personal life is a journey with multiple rewarding paths.”

                    “It is always an honor to speak to graduates as they begin the next chapter of their lives,” she said. “My prayer is that I will say something that will inspire them on their journey to fulfilling their purpose.”</p>

                 <p class="id2">The Office of Student Involvement and Leadership Programs provides programs and resources to the student body and AUM community with the belief that learning takes place in all experiences, not just in the classroom. We are dedicated to creating meaningful, co-curricular campus activities for students organizations that strive to instill a sense of community, develop leadership skills, increase appreciation of diversity, and develop character. Experiences and connections with these organizations benefit students far beyond campus into their personal and professional lives.Our vision is for our student clubs and organizations to be unified with a dynamic skill set that will support them mentally, physically, spiritual, psychologically and socially.</p>

                    <h3>College should be fun and engaging!</h3>
                    <p>Focusing on your classwork is important, but so is having a life. At AUM, you’ll have every opportunity to pursue your passions or find new ones. If you decide to live in one of our new (or recently renovated) residence halls, you’ll be in the middle of all the cultural, social and sporting events that make AUM vibrant. Even if you don’t live on campus, you can take advantage of everything campus life has to offer–and build a network of lifelong friends!From concerts to student government to theatrical productions to seasonal events, there’s always something to do on campus.</p>
